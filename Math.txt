================================================================================
1. SIMPLE MOVING AVERAGE (SMA)
================================================================================

Definition:
SMA is the unweighted mean of the previous N data points. It gives equal
weight to all observations in the calculation.

Formula:
SMA(N) = (P1 + P2 + P3 + ... + PN) / N

Where:
- P1, P2, ..., PN = Closing prices for N periods
- N = Number of periods (50 or 200 in this dashboard)

Example (50-period SMA):
If closing prices for last 50 days are: 26.80, 27.61, 27.86, ..., 46.17
Sum = 26.80 + 27.61 + 27.86 + ... + 46.17
SMA(50) = Sum / 50

In the dashboard:
- SMA 50: Short-term trend indicator (50 days)
- SMA 200: Long-term trend indicator (200 days)

Interpretation:
- Price above SMA = Bullish trend
- Price below SMA = Bearish trend
- SMA 50 above SMA 200 = Golden Cross (bullish signal)
- SMA 50 below SMA 200 = Death Cross (bearish signal)

================================================================================
2. EXPONENTIAL MOVING AVERAGE (EMA)
================================================================================

Definition:
EMA gives more weight to recent prices, making it more responsive to price
changes than SMA. Used in MACD calculation.

Formula:
EMA(today) = (Price(today) × K) + (EMA(yesterday) × (1 - K))

Where:
- K = 2 / (N + 1) = Multiplier for weighting
- N = Number of periods

Example (12-period EMA):
K = 2 / (12 + 1) = 2/13 ≈ 0.154
EMA(today) = Price(today) × 0.154 + EMA(yesterday) × 0.846

In the dashboard:
- EMA 12: Fast EMA for MACD
- EMA 26: Slow EMA for MACD
- Signal Line: 9-period EMA of MACD

================================================================================
3. RELATIVE STRENGTH INDEX (RSI)
================================================================================

Definition:
RSI is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and magnitude of price
changes. It ranges from 0 to 100.

Standard Period: 14 days

Formula:

Step 1: Calculate price changes
Change = Close(today) - Close(yesterday)

Step 2: Separate gains and losses
Gain = Change if Change > 0, else 0
Loss = -Change if Change < 0, else 0

Step 3: Calculate average gain and loss (Wilder's Smoothing)
First Average Gain = Sum of Gains for first 14 periods / 14
First Average Loss = Sum of Losses for first 14 periods / 14

Subsequent Average Gain = ((Previous Average Gain × 13) + Current Gain) / 14
Subsequent Average Loss = ((Previous Average Loss × 13) + Current Loss) / 14

Step 4: Calculate RS (Relative Strength)
RS = Average Gain / Average Loss

Step 5: Calculate RSI
RSI = 100 - (100 / (1 + RS))

Or alternatively:
RSI = 100 × (Average Gain / (Average Gain + Average Loss))

Interpretation:
- RSI > 70: Overbought (potential sell signal)
- RSI < 30: Oversold (potential buy signal)
- RSI = 50: Neutral

Example:
If Average Gain = 1.5 and Average Loss = 0.75
RS = 1.5 / 0.75 = 2
RSI = 100 - (100 / (1 + 2)) = 100 - 33.33 = 66.67

================================================================================
4. MOVING AVERAGE CONVERGENCE DIVERGENCE (MACD)
================================================================================

Definition:
MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship
between two moving averages of a security's price.

Components:
1. MACD Line = EMA(12) - EMA(26)
2. Signal Line = EMA(9) of MACD Line
3. Histogram = MACD Line - Signal Line

Formulas:

Step 1: Calculate fast and slow EMAs
EMA(12) = 12-period exponential moving average
EMA(26) = 26-period exponential moving average

Step 2: Calculate MACD Line
MACD Line = EMA(12) - EMA(26)

Step 3: Calculate Signal Line
Signal Line = 9-period EMA of MACD Line

Step 4: Calculate Histogram
Histogram = MACD Line - Signal Line

Example:
If EMA(12) = 30.50 and EMA(26) = 28.75
MACD Line = 30.50 - 28.75 = 1.75

If Signal Line = 1.20
Histogram = 1.75 - 1.20 = 0.55

Interpretation:
- MACD Line crosses above Signal Line = Buy signal (bullish)
- MACD Line crosses below Signal Line = Sell signal (bearish)
- MACD Line above zero = Upward momentum
- MACD Line below zero = Downward momentum
- Histogram positive = MACD above signal
- Histogram negative = MACD below signal

================================================================================
5. BOLLINGER BANDS
================================================================================

Definition:
Bollinger Bands are a technical analysis tool that consists of a middle band
(MA) and two outer bands at standard deviation distances. They adapt to
volatility.

Components:
1. Middle Band = SMA(N)
2. Upper Band = Middle Band + (K × Standard Deviation)
3. Lower Band = Middle Band - (K × Standard Deviation)

Where:
- N = Number of periods (typically 20)
- K = Number of standard deviations (typically 2)

Formulas:

Step 1: Calculate Simple Moving Average (Middle Band)
SMA(20) = Sum of closing prices for 20 periods / 20

Step 2: Calculate Standard Deviation
First, calculate variance:
Variance = Σ(Price - SMA)² / N

Then:
Standard Deviation = √Variance

Step 3: Calculate Upper and Lower Bands
Upper Band = SMA + (2 × Standard Deviation)
Lower Band = SMA - (2 × Standard Deviation)

Example:
If SMA(20) = 35.00 and Standard Deviation = 2.50
Upper Band = 35.00 + (2 × 2.50) = 35.00 + 5.00 = 40.00
Lower Band = 35.00 - (2 × 2.50) = 35.00 - 5.00 = 30.00

Interpretation:
- Price touches upper band = Overbought (potential reversal)
- Price touches lower band = Oversold (potential reversal)
- Bands narrow = Low volatility (potential breakout)
- Bands widen = High volatility
- Price above upper band = Strong upward trend
- Price below lower band = Strong downward trend

================================================================================
6. STATISTICAL MEASURES (MEAN & VARIANCE)
================================================================================

MEAN (AVERAGE)

Definition:
The mean is the arithmetic average of a set of numbers.

Formula:
Mean = (Σ Xi) / N

Where:
- Xi = Each individual data point
- N = Total number of data points

Example:
Prices: 26.80, 27.61, 27.86, 28.46, 28.43
Sum = 26.80 + 27.61 + 27.86 + 28.46 + 28.43 = 139.16
Mean = 139.16 / 5 = 27.832

In the dashboard:
- Daily Mean: Average closing price across all daily data
- Weekly Mean: Average closing price for each week
- Monthly Mean: Average closing price for each month

VARIANCE

Definition:
Variance measures how far a set of numbers are spread out from their average.

Formula:
Variance = Σ(Xi - Mean)² / N

Where:
- Xi = Each individual data point
- Mean = Arithmetic mean
- N = Total number of data points

Example (continuing from above):
Mean = 27.832

Variance calculation:
(26.80 - 27.832)² = (-1.032)² = 1.065
(27.61 - 27.832)² = (-0.222)² = 0.049
(27.86 - 27.832)² = (0.028)² = 0.001
(28.46 - 27.832)² = (0.628)² = 0.394
(28.43 - 27.832)² = (0.598)² = 0.358

Sum of squared differences = 1.065 + 0.049 + 0.001 + 0.394 + 0.358 = 1.867
Variance = 1.867 / 5 = 0.373

STANDARD DEVIATION

Definition:
Standard deviation is the square root of variance. It measures the average
distance from the mean.

Formula:
Standard Deviation = √Variance

Example:
Standard Deviation = √0.373 = 0.611

In the dashboard:
- Daily Variance: Variance of daily closing prices
- Weekly Variance: Variance of weekly average prices
- Monthly Variance: Variance of monthly average prices

================================================================================
7. PRICE CHANGE CALCULATIONS
================================================================================

ABSOLUTE CHANGE

Formula:
Absolute Change = Current Price - Previous Price

Example:
Previous Close = 27.61
Current Close = 26.80
Absolute Change = 26.80 - 27.61 = -0.81

PERCENTAGE CHANGE

Formula:
Percentage Change = ((Current Price - Previous Price) / Previous Price) × 100

Example:
Previous Close = 27.61
Current Close = 26.80
Percentage Change = ((26.80 - 27.61) / 27.61) × 100
                 = (-0.81 / 27.61) × 100
                 = -2.93%

VOLUME CHANGE

Formula:
Volume Change = ((Current Volume - Previous Volume) / Previous Volume) × 100

================================================================================
8. PERFORMANCE METRICS
================================================================================

BEST PERIOD (Highest Gain)

Formula:
Best Period = Maximum percentage change across all periods
Best Period Value = Max(Percentage Changes)

WORST PERIOD (Highest Loss)

Formula:
Worst Period = Minimum percentage change across all periods
Worst Period Value = Min(Percentage Changes)

POSITIVE PERIODS

Formula:
Positive Periods = Count of periods where Change > 0

NEGATIVE PERIODS

Formula:
Negative Periods = Count of periods where Change < 0

================================================================================
9. DATA AGGREGATION FORMULAS
================================================================================

WEEKLY DATA AGGREGATION

When converting daily data to weekly:
- Weekly Open = Open of first day of week
- Weekly High = Maximum High of all days in week
- Weekly Low = Minimum Low of all days in week
- Weekly Close = Close of last day of week
- Weekly Volume = Sum of Volume for all days in week

MONTHLY DATA AGGREGATION

When converting daily data to monthly:
- Monthly Open = Open of first day of month
- Monthly High = Maximum High of all days in month
- Monthly Low = Minimum Low of all days in month
- Monthly Close = Close of last day of month
- Monthly Volume = Sum of Volume for all days in month
